# File fun. Use Python to:

# -- Create a file called 'congress.txt'
# -- Build a list of dictionaries that includes up to five of a U.S. state's Congressional reps.
# -- Each dict has keys 'name', 'party', 'district'
# -- Iterate through the list of dicts and write to the file one name per line in this format:
# "1st: Rep. Robert Whitman (R)"
